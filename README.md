# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

Tic-Tac-Toe React Game

This repository contains a fully functional Tic-Tac-Toe game implemented using React.js.

Features

Two-Player Mode: Challenge a friend to a classic game of Tic-Tac-Toe.
Visual Game Board: A clear and interactive representation of the board enhances gameplay.
Win Detection and Announcement: The game automatically detects a winning player and displays a celebratory message.
Reset Button: Easily restart the game with a fresh board for a new challenge.
React-Based: Utilize the power and flexibility of React for a modern and dynamic game experience.

How to Play

Take Turns: Players take turns clicking on empty squares to place their marks (X or O).
Win or Draw: The game automatically detects a winning player who achieves three marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally). If all squares fill up without a winner, it's a draw.
Announcing the Winner: A congratulatory message with the winning player's symbol (X or O) appears upon a win.
Reset and Play Again: Click the "Reset" button to clear the board and start a new game.


Project Structure

TicTacToe.css: Contains CSS styles for the game board and elements.
TicTacToe.js: The main React component responsible for game logic, rendering, and state management.
circle.png (Optional): Image for the circle (O) player's marker.
cross.png (Optional): Image for the cross (X) player's marker.
Assets (Optional): Folder containing player icon images (if used).

Additional Notes

Consider adding screenshots or a short demo video showcasing the game in action.
If you're using a more complex game logic (e.g., AI opponent), provide a brief explanation in the README.
Feel free to customize the README further with your own branding or project-specific details.


thank you !
